Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

I am Full-Stack Developer with 3 years of experience and knowledge of a wide range of programming utilities and languages. Worked on backend & front-end requirements for both web and mobile applications. Driven to take charge and handle complete workflows from concept stage to production stage. Dedicated to achieving demanding development objectives, within tight schedules, without compromising on writing impeccable code. Able to work independently and with a team. Passionate about cutting-edge technologies.

I love open source.  I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the boyscout rule.
